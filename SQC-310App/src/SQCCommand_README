The SQCCommand script takes a single argument - the command "message", as it is referred to in the manual (4.2.1).

Despite what the manual says, the CRC calculation should include the SYNC character.
The length however just includes the command message, not the sync or CRC.
Make sure to escape any special characters and whitespace.

For example:

▶ bin/linux-x86_64/SQCCommand @
(ASCII, Decimal, Hexadecimal)
Length (+34): #, 35, 0x23
Command (without CRC): !#@
CRC1: O, 79, 0x4f
CRC2: 7, 55, 0x37
Full Command: !#@O7

This matches the example for the hello command in the manual, once you convert from decimal to ASCII (4.3.1.1)).

Another example:

▶ bin/linux-x86_64/SQCCommand F1\ 1,5
(ASCII, Decimal, Hexadecimal)
Length (+34): (, 40, 0x28
Command (without CRC): !(F1 1,5
CRC1: G, 71, 0x47
CRC2: |, 124, 0x7c
Full Command: !(F1 1,5G|
